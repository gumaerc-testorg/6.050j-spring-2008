### Technical

Seminal papers on the Principle of Maximum Entropy by Edwin T. Jaynes (July 5, 1922 – April 30, 1998):

### Books

There are many textbooks on thermodynamics and energy conversion.

*   Silbey, R., R. Alberty, and M. Bawendi. _Physical Chemistry_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 2004. ISBN: 9780471215042.  
    These authors are from MIT. Alberty was formerly Dean of Science, and Silbey was until recently Dean of Science. It's amazing that anyone can be a Dean and still keep up with science.
*   Typical excellent book in a traditional style, Zemansky, Mark W. _Heat and Thermodynamics_. 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1951, or earlier editions starting in 1937.  
    This book does not mention information and starts with assumed knowledge about temperature, pressure, and volume. Suitable for advanced undergraduates.
*   Introductory book, used for sophomores, covering classical thermodynamics (no information), Van Ness, H. C. _Understanding Thermodynamics_. New York, NY: Dover Publications, 1969.  
    Succinct and carefully crafted treatment.
*   Book covering both equilibrium and irreversible thermodynamics, Callen, Herbert B. _Thermodynamics_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1962.
*   Careful treatment of classical thermodynamics (no mention of information) with emphasis on the mathematical formalism, Truesdell, C. _Rational Thermodynamics_. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1969.  
    Suitable for graduate courses, for those with some prior exposure to thermodynamics.
*   Textbook developed at MIT in energy conversion (no thermodynamics), White, David C., and Herbert H. Woodson. _Electromechanical Energy Conversion_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1959.
*   An early textbook to use the Principle of Maximum Entropy as an approach to thermodynamics is Tribus, M. _Thermostatics and Thermodynamics_. Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Co, Inc., 1961.
