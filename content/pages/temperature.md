### Technical

Seminal papers on the Principle of Maximum Entropy by Edwin T. Jaynes (July 5, 1922 – April 30, 1998):

- Jaynes, E. T. "[Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics (PDF - 2.1 MB)](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf)." *Physical Review* 106 (May 15, 1957): 620–630.   
    This paper started the use of the Principle of Maximum Entropy in physics.
- ———. "[Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics II (PDF - 3.6 MB)](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.2.pdf)." *Physical Review* 108 (October 15, 1957): 171–190.   
    Continuation of the previous reference.

### Books

There are many textbooks on thermodynamics and energy conversion.

- Silbey, R., R. Alberty, and M. Bawendi. *Physical Chemistry*. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 2004. ISBN: 9780471215042.   
    These authors are from MIT. Alberty was formerly Dean of Science, and Silbey was until recently Dean of Science. It's amazing that anyone can be a Dean and still keep up with science.
- Typical excellent book in a traditional style, Zemansky, Mark W. *Heat and Thermodynamics*. 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1951, or earlier editions starting in 1937. This book does not mention information and starts with assumed knowledge about temperature, pressure, and volume. Suitable for advanced undergraduates.
- Introductory book, used for sophomores, covering classical thermodynamics (no information), Van Ness, H. C. *Understanding Thermodynamics*. New York, NY: Dover Publications, 1969. Succinct and carefully crafted treatment.
- Book covering both equilibrium and irreversible thermodynamics, Callen, Herbert B. *Thermodynamics*. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1962.
- Careful treatment of classical thermodynamics (no mention of information) with emphasis on the mathematical formalism, Truesdell, C. *Rational Thermodynamics*. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Suitable for graduate courses, for those with some prior exposure to thermodynamics.
- Textbook developed at MIT in energy conversion (no thermodynamics), White, David C., and Herbert H. Woodson. *Electromechanical Energy Conversion*. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1959.
- An early textbook to use the Principle of Maximum Entropy as an approach to thermodynamics is Tribus, M. *Thermostatics and Thermodynamics*. Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Co, Inc., 1961.
